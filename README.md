# Intro.
This repository has two Plugin Gameroom samples, one is a win32 application, another one with `js` suffix  is a JavaScript project based on cocos2d-js.

# Precondition
`cocos2d-x` is too large to be stored in this repo, so before running the samples, you should download `cocos2d` first. And then copy it to both `cocos_gameroom_sample\` and `cocos_gameroom_sample_js\frameworks` individually.
Specially, in `cocos_gameroom_sample`, it should be renamed to `cocos2d`.

## Running 
Open the Solution in the `cocos_gameroom_sample\proj.win32` or `cocos_gameroom_sample_js\frameworks\runtime-src` to run the sample.
